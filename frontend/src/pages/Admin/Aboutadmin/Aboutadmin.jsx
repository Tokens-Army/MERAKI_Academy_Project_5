      <h2>How we wash the car?</h2>
      <p>
        Steps we do to make your car cleaner: Nothing makes your car look better
        than a good wash. It’s a critical step if you’re selling your used car,
        but even if you're not, it's important for good maintenance and to help
        you enjoy your ride. The best car wash can happen in your driveway with
        a hose, some soap, cleaning mitts and a few buckets of water. Pick a
        good location. You don’t want to clean the car in direct sunlight or
        direct heat as the soap will dry onto the car before you can rinse it
        off. Aim to wash the car in the early morning or late evening and don’t
        wash it near a dusty road or under a tree where buds, bugs and leaves
        can fall and stick to the car. Make sure your hose has a nozzle with
        enough pressure to spray the car and one that allows you to stop the
        water flow when you want. This way you’re not running water throughout
        the entire process. Focus on the wheels
